Implement a set of functions to assist in the structuring and validation of your forms.
Use this API to build forms and data models and provide validation for your forms. Validators can be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on your use case.

The recoil model allows:
- Capture the current value and validation status of a form.
- Validate the accuracy of user input.
- Create custom validators and input elements.
